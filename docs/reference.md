# Reference

Every value of both charts, then the ceremony's
[hierarchy file](#hierarchy-file), [`openbaoctl`](#openbaoctl), the
[`pkg/custody`](#pkgcustody) inputs, and the desired-state
[`pkg/model`](#pkgmodel) and its [`pkg/apply`](#pkgapply). `charts/<chart>/values.yaml` carries the same
keys with their defaults and a comment each, and `values.schema.json` is
the authority on types: an unknown key fails the render.

Every object name is a value, and none carries the release name or Helm's
own labels — the names below are what an existing install adopts
([adoption.md](adoption.md#adopting-objects-that-already-run)).

## openbao-ops

Every part is off until enabled, so one install can carry any subset.

| Part | Objects |
|---|---|
| `snapshot` | ServiceAccount, one CronJob per tier |
| `restoreCheck` | ServiceAccount, ConfigMap, CronJob |
| `certificateExpiry` | ServiceAccount, Role, RoleBinding, CronJob |
| `pluginCatalog` | ServiceAccount, CronJob |
| `networkPolicy` | the server's ingress, an ingress deny per job pod and per `isolated` entry, `egress.rules` |
| `serverCertificate` | Certificate |
| `tlsReload` | nothing: a fragment for the upstream chart |

### Top level, `server`, `auth`

| Value | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `commonAnnotations` | `{}` | Added to every object. Each part's `annotations` are merged over it. |
| `namespace` | `""` | Where every object lives. Empty: the release namespace. |
| `server.address` | `""` | The API address the jobs dial. Empty: `https://<activeService>.<namespace>.svc:<apiPort>`. |
| `server.activeService` | `openbao-active` | The Service that resolves to the active pod. Writes must not land on a standby. |
| `server.service` | `openbao` | The main Service; one of the certificate's in-cluster names. |
| `server.headlessService` | `openbao-internal` | The Service peers dial each other through; the certificate carries a wildcard over it. |
| `server.apiPort` | `8200` | API port, in the default address and the policies. |
| `server.clusterPort` | `8201` | Raft port, open between peers only. |
| `server.tlsSecretName` | `openbao-tls` | The serving certificate's Secret — and the Certificate's name. |
| `server.caKey` | `ca.crt` | The key in that Secret the snapshot job verifies the server with. |
| `server.tlsServerName` | `""` | The name the jobs verify the server against when it is not the name they dial (`BAO_TLS_SERVER_NAME`). Set it when the certificate names only the endpoint. |
| `server.podLabels` | `app.kubernetes.io/name: openbao`, `component: server` | How the server pods are selected by the policies. |
| `auth.mountPath` | `jwt` | The JWT auth mount the jobs log in to. |
| `auth.audience` | `openbao` | The audience of the jobs' projected token. A token for this audience cannot be replayed against the Kubernetes API. |
| `auth.expirationSeconds` | `600` | The projected token's lifetime (600–86400). |
| `auth.tokenMountPath` | `/var/run/openbao` | Where the token is mounted; the jobs read `<tokenMountPath>/token`. |

### snapshot

| Value | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Render the snapshot jobs. |
| `serviceAccountName` | `openbao-snapshot` | The ServiceAccount, and the pods' `app.kubernetes.io/name` label the policies select. |
| `serviceAccountAnnotations` | `{}` | On the ServiceAccount only, over `annotations` (e.g. a cloud role binding). |
| `annotations` | `{}` | On every object of the part. |
| `baoRole` | `openbao-snapshot` | The OpenBAO role the job logs in as. |
| `jobs` | 6-hourly `raft/`, weekly `weekly/` | One CronJob per entry: `name`, `schedule`, `prefix`. A prefix per tier lets a lifecycle rule expire tiers differently. The weekly copy is a snapshot of its own, never a copy of an object: the writer cannot read. |
| `timeZone` | `Etc/UTC` | The CronJobs' time zone. |
| `startingDeadlineSeconds` | `3600` | A run that starts late is still worth taking. |
| `activeDeadlineSeconds` | `900` | Per run. |
| `backoffLimit` | `2` | Retries per run. |
| `workSizeLimit` | `2Gi` | The emptyDir the snapshot is written to. |
| `nodeSelector`, `tolerations` | none | Pod placement. |
| `image` | `openbao/openbao:2.6.2` | Takes and verifies the snapshot. Keep it equal to the server's image. `repository`, `tag`, `digest` (wins over the tag), `pullPolicy` (empty: the cluster default). |
| `resources` | 10m / 64Mi, limit 256Mi | The snapshot container. |
| `upload.image` | `amazon/aws-cli:2.36.44` | The uploader. |
| `upload.command`, `upload.args`, `upload.env` | none | A replacement uploader (the contract above). |
| `upload.resources` | 10m / 128Mi, limit 512Mi | |
| `upload.s3.enabled` | `false` | The S3 preset: `aws s3 cp` with a checksum. |
| `upload.s3.bucket`, `upload.s3.region` | `""` | Required with the preset. |
| `upload.s3.endpoint` | `""` | Any store that speaks the S3 API. Empty keeps the AWS endpoint; set, it is `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3`, and the CLI's default request and response checksums are turned down to `when_required`, which a store that is not AWS may not implement. Must be an `http(s)` URL. MinIO and Ceph RGW: the store's own URL; Cloudflare R2: `https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` with `region: auto`. |
| `upload.s3.pathStyle` | `false` | Address the bucket as `endpoint/bucket/key` rather than `bucket.endpoint/key`: a property of the store's certificate, so its own switch. The CLI reads it from its config file alone; the script writes that one line and `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` names it. |
| `upload.s3.existingSecret` | `""` | A Secret holding `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (and optionally `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`), given through `envFrom`, for a store with no pod identity. Empty keeps the pod's ambient identity. |
| `upload.s3.checksumAlgorithm` | `SHA256` | Sent with every object, whatever the store. |
| `upload.s3.multipartThreshold` | `1GB` | The size above which the CLI splits the upload into parts (its own default is 8MB). One PUT needs only `kms:GenerateDataKey` on an SSE-KMS bucket; a multipart upload also needs `kms:Decrypt`. Written to the CLI's config file, which `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` names. Empty keeps the CLI's default. |

### restoreCheck

| Value | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Render the weekly restore check. |
| `serviceAccountName` | `openbao-restore-check` | The ServiceAccount, ConfigMap and CronJob, and the pods' label. |
| `serviceAccountAnnotations`, `annotations` | `{}` | As for `snapshot`. |
| `baoRole` | `openbao-restore-check` | The role the check logs in as on the restored copy. |
| `schedule` | `37 5 * * 0` | Sundays, after the snapshots. |
| `timeZone`, `startingDeadlineSeconds` | `Etc/UTC`, `3600` | |
| `activeDeadlineSeconds` | `1200` | |
| `backoffLimit` | `1` | |
| `workSizeLimit` | `2Gi` | The snapshot's and the scratch server's emptyDirs. |
| `nodeId` | `restore-check` | The scratch server's Raft node id. |
| `nodeSelector`, `tolerations` | none | |
| `maxSnapshotAgeSeconds` | `43200` | A newest snapshot older than this fails the check. |
| `image` | `openbao/openbao:2.6.2` | The scratch server and the check. Keep it equal to the server's image. |
| `sealConfig` | *required* | Raw HCL of the scratch server's seal. A snapshot opens only under the seal that wrapped its keyring — the same key, or a replica of it; a replica in another region proves a snapshot opens without the primary region. |
| `sealDescription` | `""` | How the pass line names that seal. |
| `sealPlugin` | `{}` | OpenBAO 2.7 only, opt-in: installs the external KMS seal plugin into the scratch server. `directory` (plugin_directory), `initContainer` (copies the binary into the emptyDir this chart mounts as `seal-plugin`) and `sourceVolume` (the digest-pinned image volume it reads); the last two go together. Generate it, and `sealConfig` with the `plugin "kms"` block, with `serverpreset.Config.RestoreCheckValues()`; see [server.md](server.md#the-restore-check-needs-the-plugin-too). Unset: the render is unchanged. |
| `auditConfig` | a `file` device to stdout | Raw HCL of the scratch server's audit devices. OpenBAO refuses API-created audit devices, so declare them exactly as production does. |
| `serverEnv` | none | The scratch server's environment (e.g. the seal's region). |
| `serverResources` | 50m / 128Mi, limit 512Mi | |
| `resources` | 10m / 64Mi, limit 256Mi | The check container. |
| `fetch.*` | as `snapshot.upload` | The fetcher: `image`, `command`, `args`, `env`, `resources`, and the S3 preset `s3.enabled`, `s3.bucket`, `s3.region`, `s3.endpoint`, `s3.pathStyle`, `s3.existingSecret`, `s3.prefix` (`raft/`: the tier it restores from). |
| `canary.enabled` | `true` | Read a canary back in every namespace. At least one of `canary` and `pki` must be on, unless `loginOnly` is set. |
| `loginOnly` | `false` | Accept the login to the restored copy as the whole proof when `canary` and `pki` are both off (an install with no KV mount and no PKI). It does not excuse `sealConfig`. |
| `canary.kvMount` | `kv` | The KV v2 mount holding the canary. |
| `canary.path` | `restore-canary` | Its path. Its data must be exactly `{namespace: <the namespace's name>}`. |
| `canary.namespaces` | `[]` | Empty: every namespace the restored copy lists, and none listed is a failure. |
| `pki.enabled` | `false` | Walk and exercise the restored PKI. |
| `pki.trustAnchor.certificate` | *required* | Base64 PEM of the root you committed. |
| `pki.trustAnchor.name` | `""` | Its name, for the pass line. |
| `pki.intermediate.mount`, `pki.intermediate.issuer` | `pki-int`, *required* | The domain intermediate the root signed, in the root namespace. |
| `pki.issuing.mount`, `pki.issuing.issuerPrefix` | `pki`, *required* | Each namespace's issuing CA: `<ns>/<mount>/issuer/<issuerPrefix>-<ns>`. |
| `pki.namespaces` | *required* | The namespaces with an issuing CA; one leaf is issued in each. |
| `pki.role` | `restore-check` | The issuing role; it should allow exactly `<role>.<ns>.<domain>`. |
| `pki.domain` | *required* | |
| `pki.ttl` | `1h` | The leaves' lifetime. |
| `pki.refusals.enabled` | `true` | Prove the role refuses a wildcard, a subdomain, IP, URI and e-mail SANs. |
| `pki.refusals.namespace` | `""` | Where; empty: the first of `pki.namespaces`. |

### certificateExpiry

| Value | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Render the daily expiry check. |
| `name` | `openbao-tls-expiry` | The ServiceAccount, Role, RoleBinding and CronJob, and the pods' label. |
| `annotations` | `{}` | On every object of the part. |
| `certificateName` | `""` | The Certificate to read. Empty: `server.tlsSecretName`. |
| `clusterName` | `""` | Named in the alert. |
| `certManagerNamespace` | `cert-manager` | Named in the alert's "look at" line. |
| `schedule`, `timeZone` | `23 7 * * *`, `Etc/UTC` | Daily: one alert a day while it lasts. |
| `startingDeadlineSeconds`, `activeDeadlineSeconds`, `backoffLimit` | `3600`, `300`, `0` | |
| `alertBeforeSeconds` | `1814400` | 21 days. Must be less than the renewal lead time: an alert before renewal has started is noise. |
| `renewBeforeSeconds` | `0` | The renewal lead time, for the alert text. `0`: `serverCertificate.renewBefore`, which must then be whole hours. |
| `nodeSelector`, `tolerations` | none | |
| `read.image`, `read.resources` | `alpine/kubectl:1.34.2`, 10m / 32Mi | Reads the Certificate's status. |
| `alert.image` | `amazon/aws-cli:2.36.44` | |
| `alert.command`, `alert.args`, `alert.env`, `alert.resources` | none | A replacement alert (the contract above). |
| `alert.sns.enabled` | `false` | The SNS preset: publish, then fail the run. At most one preset may be on. |
| `alert.sns.topicArn`, `alert.sns.region` | `""` | Required with the preset. |
| `alert.sns.runbook` | `""` | A last line of the message: where the way back is written down. |
| `alert.alertmanager.enabled` | `false` | The Alertmanager preset: one POST, then fail the run. At most one preset may be on. |
| `alert.alertmanager.url` | `""` | Required with the preset: where Alertmanager answers, e.g. `http://alertmanager.example.svc:9093`. The chart appends `/api/v2/alerts`, so a value that is not an `http(s)` origin fails the render. |
| `alert.alertmanager.alertname` | `OpenBAOCertificateExpiring` | The `alertname` label. |
| `alert.alertmanager.severity` | `warning` | The `severity` label. |
| `alert.alertmanager.release` | `""` | The `release` label, which tells two installs apart; empty leaves the label out. A value like every other name here, never Helm's release name. |
| `alert.alertmanager.runbook` | `""` | The `runbook` annotation: where the way back is written down. |
| `alert.alertmanager.image` | `curlimages/curl:8.22.0` | This preset's image, because `alert.image` defaults to the AWS CLI. Anything with a POSIX shell and curl does. |

### serverMetrics

The server's own metrics: a PodMonitor, the scraper's rule in the server's
ingress policy, and alerts. See [server.md](server.md#metrics) for the
server-side settings that make `/v1/sys/metrics` answer, which this part
requires and does not render.

| Value | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Render the part. |
| `podMonitor.enabled` | `true` | The PodMonitor. |
| `podMonitor.name`, `.namespace`, `.labels`, `.annotations` | `openbao-server`, release namespace | The object. The CA Secret (`server.tlsSecretName`) must be in its namespace. |
| `port` | `9101` | The metrics listener's port, the one `networkPolicy.serverIngress` admits the scraper to. Must be the port `Config.Telemetry.MetricsAddress` renders and differ from `server.apiPort` and `server.clusterPort`. |
| `podMonitor.port` | `metrics` | The NAME of the container port the metrics listener is on; the server pods must declare it. |
| `podMonitor.interval`, `.scrapeTimeout` | `30s`, `10s` | |
| `scraper` | `[]` | NetworkPolicyPeer entries admitted to the metrics port, and only that port, by `networkPolicy.serverIngress`, in addition to every other rule. |
| `alerts.enabled` | `false` | Render the rules. |
| `alerts.format` | `vmrule` | `vmrule`, `prometheusrule` or `configmap`. |
| `alerts.name`, `.namespace`, `.labels`, `.annotations`, `.ruleLabels`, `.groupName`, `.interval` | | As `openbao-consumers`' alerts. |
| `alerts.selector` | `""` | Extra matchers added to every selector after `namespace="<release namespace>"`. |
| `alerts.rules.<rule>` | | `enabled`, `for`, `severity`, `labels`, `annotations`; rules: `sealed` (5m, critical), `noActiveNode` (3m, critical), `raftUnhealthy` (10m, warning, `minHealthyVoters: 3`), `raftCommitLag` (10m, warning, `maxIndexDelta: 500`), `auditFailures` (2m, critical), `highLatency` (15m, warning, `thresholdMilliseconds: 1000`), `scrapeDown` (10m, warning), `metricsAbsent` (15m, warning). |

### serverAlerts.pluginDownload

Two LogsQL alerts, as a `VMRule`, on the server's own log: a declarative
plugin download that is failing and has not recovered, and the retry sidecar
giving up. Off by default. The prose is in the
[chart README](../charts/openbao-ops/README.md#serveralertsplugindownload).

| Value | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Render the object. |
| `plugin` | `""` | Required: the plugin whose download is watched (`auth/aws`), named in the text. |
| `name`, `namespace`, `labels`, `annotations`, `ruleLabels`, `groupName` | `<release>-plugin-download`, release namespace, `observability.rule-type: vlogs` and `observability.truvity.io/evaluator: logs`, | The object, and the labels added to every rule. |
| `interval` | `15m` | Whole minutes: the group interval, which is also the lookback of both rules. |
| `clusterName` | `""` | The `k8s_cluster_name` label of every rule. |
| `decision`, `runbook` | `""` | A reference rendered after "permanently" in the first description, and the `runbook` annotation. |
| `serverContainer` | `openbao` | The container whose log the first rule reads. |
| `sidecar.container`, `.attempts`, `.budgetMinutes` | `tls-reload`, `20`, `10` | The retry sidecar the second rule reads, its attempt count and the minutes that takes. |
| `rules.downloadFailing`, `rules.sidecarGaveUp` | enabled, `for` unset, `warning` | `enabled`, `for`, `severity`, `labels`, `annotations`. |

### pluginCatalog

Are the plugins [`pkg/serverpreset`](#pkgserverpreset) declares actually
in the catalog, at the version a mount will ask for? See
[server.md](server.md#the-plugin-catalog-three-faults-fixed-once). Reading
`sys/plugins/catalog/<type>/<name>` needs a policy granting **both** `read`
and `sudo` on that path, per entry, in the root namespace — this chart
never creates that policy or the role bound to it (docs/doctrine.md's
ownership contract).

| Value | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Render the watch. |
| `name` | `openbao-plugin-catalog` | The ServiceAccount and the CronJob, and the pods' label. |
| `annotations` | `{}` | On every object of the part. |
| `serviceAccountAnnotations` | `{}` | On the ServiceAccount only, over `annotations`. |
| `clusterName` | `""` | Named in the alert. |
| `baoRole` | `openbao-plugin-catalog` | The OpenBAO role the watch logs in as: `read` and `sudo` on `sys/plugins/catalog/<type>/<name>` per entry below, and nothing else. |
| `schedule`, `timeZone` | `58 * * * *`, `Etc/UTC` | Hourly. |
| `startingDeadlineSeconds`, `activeDeadlineSeconds`, `backoffLimit` | `600`, `300`, `0` | A retry would deliver the same alert twice, and the next run is an hour away. |
| `nodeSelector`, `tolerations` | none | |
| `image` | `openbao/openbao:2.6.2` | Needs the `bao` CLI to log in and read the catalog. |
| `resources` | 10m / 64Mi, limit 256Mi | |
| `plugins` | `[]` *(required)* | One entry per plugin `pkg/serverpreset`'s `Config` declares: `type` (`auth`, `secret` or `database` — the catalog path's first segment), `name`, `version`, optionally `description`, `oci` and `declarative`. This list is also the whole of what the watch's role may read, named entry by entry; two entries naming the same `type`/`name` fail the render. |
| `plugins[].oci`, `plugins[].declarative` | `false` (unchecked) | When `true`, the entry must also report that field as `true`, or it counts as a problem — only the declarative download path can set either, so a `false` on an otherwise-matching entry is a catalog entry an API call created, not one the download registered. |
| `alert.image` | `amazon/aws-cli:2.36.44` | |
| `alert.command`, `alert.args`, `alert.env`, `alert.resources` | none | A replacement alert (the contract above). |
| `alert.sns.enabled` | `false` | The SNS preset: publish, then fail the run. At most one preset may be on. |
| `alert.sns.topicArn`, `alert.sns.region` | `""` | Required with the preset. |
| `alert.sns.runbook` | `""` | A last line of the message: where the way back is written down. |
| `alert.alertmanager.enabled` | `false` | The Alertmanager preset: one POST, then fail the run. At most one preset may be on. |
| `alert.alertmanager.url` | `""` | Required with the preset: where Alertmanager answers. The chart appends `/api/v2/alerts`, so a value that is not an `http(s)` origin fails the render. |
| `alert.alertmanager.alertname` | `OpenBAOPluginMissing` | The `alertname` label. |
| `alert.alertmanager.severity` | `critical` | The `severity` label. |
| `alert.alertmanager.release` | `""` | The `release` label, which tells two installs apart; empty leaves the label out. |
| `alert.alertmanager.runbook` | `""` | The `runbook` annotation: where the way back is written down. |
| `alert.alertmanager.image` | `curlimages/curl:8.22.0` | This preset's image, because `alert.image` defaults to the AWS CLI. |

### networkPolicy

| Value | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Render the policies. |
| `annotations` | `{}` | On every policy. |
| `names.serverIngress` | `openbao-ingress` | The server's ingress policy. |
| `names.restoreCheckIngress` | `openbao-restore-check-ingress` | Rendered with `restoreCheck`: nothing may connect in. |
| `names.certificateExpiryIngress` | `openbao-tls-expiry-ingress` | Rendered with `certificateExpiry`: nothing may connect in. |
| `clientCidrs` | *required* | The ranges that may reach the API port. |
| `extraClientSelectors` | `[]` | More API clients, as raw NetworkPolicyPeer entries. |
| `isolated` | `[]` | More pods nothing may connect to (`name`, `podSelector`), e.g. a hand-run rebuild drill that holds a restored copy. |
| `egress.enabled` | `false` | Render `egress.rules`. |
| `egress.rules` | `[]` | Whole egress policies: `name`, `podSelector`, `egress` (passed through), and optionally `apiVersion` and `kind` — a standard NetworkPolicy is CIDR-based, and a CNI extension that names hosts has its own kind. |

The server's ingress admits `clientCidrs` and `extraClientSelectors` to the
API port, the server's own pods to the API and Raft ports, and — with
`snapshot` — the snapshot pods to the API port.

### serverCertificate

| Value | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Render the Certificate (named `server.tlsSecretName`). |
| `externalDnsName` | `""` | The endpoint clients outside the cluster use; first in the SAN list. |
| `commonName` | `""` | Empty: `externalDnsName`. |
| `serviceDnsNames` | `true` | Add the Services' in-cluster names and a wildcard over the peers. Turn it off for a name-constrained chain that cannot carry them; clients then verify the endpoint (see [server.md](server.md#verifying-one-name)). |
| `extraDnsNames` | `[]` | More names. The chart deliberately never names a load balancer, so a replaced one needs no reissue. |
| `ipAddresses` | `[127.0.0.1]` | IP SANs, for the in-pod CLI. `[]` with a name-constrained chain. |
| `duration`, `renewBefore` | `2160h`, `720h` | 90 days, renewed a month before the end. |
| `privateKey` | ECDSA 256, rotation Always | Must match what the issuer's role signs: a CSR that disagrees is refused, not downgraded. |
| `issuerRef` | *name required* | The estate's issuer. |
| `annotations` | `{}` | On the Certificate. |

### tlsReload

The sidecar fragment `ops.tlsReloadContainer`, for the upstream chart —
see [server.md](server.md#reloading-a-renewed-certificate).

| Value | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `intervalSeconds` | `60` | How often the certificate file is compared. |
| `certPath` | `/openbao/userconfig/openbao-tls/tls.crt` | The file watched. |
| `volumeName`, `mountPath` | `userconfig-openbao-tls`, `/openbao/userconfig/openbao-tls` | The upstream chart's volume for the TLS Secret. |
| `image` | `openbao/openbao:2.6.2` | Needs `sh`, `cksum`, `tr` and `kill`: the server image has them. |
| `resources` | 5m / 8Mi, limit 32Mi | |

## openbao-consumers

Stores and PKI are independent: an install may render either or both.

| Part | Objects |
|---|---|
| `stores` | one ClusterSecretStore per kind, `<name>-<storeSuffix>` |
| `writers` | one ClusterSecretStore per (writer, environment), `<name>-<environment>` |
| `awsStores` | one ClusterSecretStore on AWS Parameter Store per entry, `<name>`, and in `webIdentity` mode its ServiceAccount ([esoaws.md](esoaws.md)) |
| `aws.admissionPolicy` | a ValidatingAdmissionPolicy and binding, `<release>-aws-stores`; on by default in `podIdentity` mode |
| `pki.trustAnchors` | one ConfigMap per root, in `pki.certManager.namespace` |
| `pki.issuers` | the login's ServiceAccount, Role and RoleBinding (`<issuerServiceAccount>-token`), and one issuer per entry |
| `pki.bundle` | a trust-manager Bundle |
| `certificates` | one Certificate per entry |

| Value | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `commonAnnotations` | `{}` | Added to every object; per-object `annotations` are merged over it. |
| `server` | `""` | The OpenBAO endpoint. Required when a store or an issuer renders. |
| `caBundle` | `""` | Base64 PEM of the CA that signed the server's certificate. Required when a store or an issuer renders. |
| `vaultNamespace` | `""` | The OpenBAO namespace stores and issuers address. Empty on an install without namespaces. |
| `kvMount` | `kv` | The KV v2 mount every store reads and writes. |
| `storeSuffix` | `openbao` | A reader store is `<name>-<storeSuffix>`, distinguishable from a same-named store on another provider during a migration. |
| `auth.mountPath` | `jwt` | This cluster's JWT auth mount — usually named after the cluster. Issuers log in on it as `/v1/auth/<mountPath>`. |
| `auth.audience` | `openbao` | The stores' token audience. |
| `auth.expirationSeconds` | `600` | The stores' token lifetime (600–86400). |
| `auth.serviceAccount.name`, `.namespace` | `external-secrets`, `external-secrets` | The identity reader stores present. |
| `writerAuthMount` | `""` | The mount writer stores log in on. Empty: `auth.mountPath`. |
| `stores[].name` | *required* | The kind. The store is `<name>-<storeSuffix>`. |
| `stores[].role` | the name | The OpenBAO role, so the policy that bounds a store is findable from the store. |
| `stores[].vaultNamespace` | `vaultNamespace` | |
| `stores[].conditions` | *required* | The namespaces that may use the store. Without them it is readable from every namespace on the cluster. Each condition must select something: a non-empty `namespaces`, a `namespaceSelector` with non-empty `matchLabels` or `matchExpressions`, or `namespaceRegexes`, each anchored (`^...$`) with no `|` outside a group, and none matching every namespace. |
| `stores[].annotations` | `{}` | |
| `writers[].name` | *required* | The writer; also its OpenBAO role. |
| `writers[].namespace` | *required* | Where its ServiceAccount lives — the one namespace the store admits. |
| `writers[].serviceAccount` | *required* | The identity the store presents. |
| `writers[].environments` | *required* | One store `<name>-<environment>` per entry, addressing that OpenBAO namespace. |
| `writers[].annotations` | `{}` | |
| `aws.identity` | `""` | Required with `awsStores`, no default: `podIdentity` (the External Secrets controller holds its own EKS Pod Identity credentials and assumes each store's `role`) or `webIdentity` (nothing holds credentials; each store names its own ServiceAccount). One mode per cluster: a store that does not match the mode is refused. |
| `aws.webIdentity.audience` | `sts.amazonaws.com` | The audience the reader roles require (`esoaws.WebIdentity.Audience`), set as `eks.amazonaws.com/audience` on each ServiceAccount the chart renders. |
| `aws.admissionPolicy.enabled` | `null` | The AWS stores' admission policy (Kubernetes 1.30+); `null` is on in `podIdentity` mode and off otherwise. See [esoaws.md](esoaws.md#the-admission-policy). |
| `aws.admissionPolicy.name` | `<release>-aws-stores` | Name of the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy and its binding. |
| `aws.admissionPolicy.labels`, `.annotations` | `{}` | On both objects. Annotations merge over `commonAnnotations` and over the default `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "-1"`, which applies the policy before the stores it describes ([upgrades](esoaws.md#upgrades-the-policy-goes-first)). |
| `aws.admissionPolicy.validationActions` | `[Deny]` | Any of `Deny`, `Warn`, `Audit`; `[Warn, Audit]` is the dry run. |
| `aws.admissionPolicy.failurePolicy` | `Fail` | `Fail` or `Ignore`. |
| `aws.admissionPolicy.acknowledgeTenantsCanBorrowControllerIdentity` | `false` | In `podIdentity` mode, turning the policy off, dropping `Deny` or setting `failurePolicy: Ignore` fails the render unless this is `true`. |
| `awsStores[].name` | *required* | The store's name, as given: one store per (cluster, grant). Needs no `server` or `caBundle`. |
| `awsStores[].region` | *required* | The region of the parameters it reads. |
| `awsStores[].role` | *required* | The grant's reader role in the parameters' account (`esoaws.Readers.RoleARNs`): one IAM role ARN, no wildcard. `podIdentity`: the store's `role`, assumed with the controller's credentials. `webIdentity`: the `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn` of the store's ServiceAccount; the store itself carries no role, which would be assumed on top. |
| `awsStores[].conditions` | *required* | The namespaces that may use the store: `namespaces` (a non-empty list) or a `namespaceSelector` with non-empty `matchLabels` or `matchExpressions`, each expression `operator: In` with at least one value. No `namespaceRegexes`. Without conditions, or with one that selects everything, it is refused. |
| `awsStores[].auth.jwt.serviceAccountRef.name`, `.namespace` | *required* in `webIdentity`, refused in `podIdentity` | The store's own ServiceAccount, the grant's `esoaws.Grant.ServiceAccount`. The namespace is required: without it, a ClusterSecretStore's reference resolves in the namespace of each ExternalSecret that uses it. The only auth shape the chart renders. |
| `awsStores[].serviceAccount.create` | `true` | `webIdentity` only: render that ServiceAccount, annotated with the role and audience and mounting no token. `false`: you provide it, with the same annotations. |
| `awsStores[].serviceAccount.annotations` | `{}` | On a rendered ServiceAccount; the role and audience annotations are the chart's. |
| `awsStores[].annotations` | `{}` | |
| `pki.enabled` | `false` | Render the anchors, the issuers and the bundle. |
| `pki.annotations` | `{}` | On the anchors and on the login's ServiceAccount, Role and RoleBinding. |
| `pki.certManager.namespace` | `cert-manager` | Where the anchors, the login and namespaced issuers live; the default namespace of `certificates`. |
| `pki.certManager.serviceAccountName` | `cert-manager` | cert-manager's own identity, bound to mint the login's tokens. |
| `pki.issuerServiceAccount` | `openbao-issuer` | The identity issuers log in as; its Role and RoleBinding are `<name>-token`. |
| `pki.vaultNamespace` | `""` | Default for every issuer; empty: `vaultNamespace`. |
| `pki.authMountPath` | `""` | The auth mount the issuers log in on; empty: `auth.mountPath`. |
| `pki.trustAnchors` | *required* | Each: `name` (the ConfigMap), `certificate` (base64 PEM), optional `labels`, `annotations`. Public certificates only. |
| `pki.rootKey` | `ca.crt` | The key each anchor's ConfigMap holds its certificate under. |
| `pki.issuers` | `[]` | Each: `name`, `signPath` (the role that bounds what it signs), `role` (the auth role), optional `kind` (`ClusterIssuer` or `Issuer`), `audiences`, `vaultNamespace`, `annotations`, `identity` (the SPIFFE identity issuer: rendered like any other, never given a policy). A Vault issuer's path is fixed, so a second chain or role is a second issuer. |
| `pki.bundle.enabled` | `true` | Render the Bundle. |
| `pki.bundle.name` | `openbao-private-ca` | |
| `pki.bundle.annotations` | `{}` | |
| `pki.bundle.extraSources` | `[]` | Sources placed BEFORE the anchors — during a migration, the old root or a Secret-held CA. |
| `pki.bundle.target.key` | `ca-certificates.crt` | The key of the ConfigMap trust-manager writes in each namespace. |
| `pki.bundle.target.namespaceSelector` | `{}` | Where it writes; `{}` is every namespace. |
| `pki.bundles` | `[]` | More Bundles beside `pki.bundle`, rendered in order. Each: `name` (unique, not `pki.bundle.name`), `annotations` (passed through as given, e.g. a GitOps controller's sync options), `sources` (one or more `inLine` PEM entries, rendered as given; nothing is derived from the anchors) and `target.key` and `target.namespaceSelector`, both required (`{}` is every namespace). A selector matches a label or a name, not both, so one trust for two audiences is two entries. |
| `approverPolicy.enabled` | `false` | Render the [approver layer](approver.md): a `CertificateRequestPolicy` per non-identity issuer, the optional namespaced-issuers policy, and the `use` RBAC. Needs `pki.issuers`. |
| `approverPolicy.issuers` | `{}` | Keyed by issuer name, one entry for every issuer without `identity: true`: `commonName`, `dnsNames`, `uris`, `ipAddresses`, `emailAddresses` (globs, at least one required), `usages`, `minDuration`, `maxDuration`, `privateKey`. A `spiffe:` URI is refused. |
| `approverPolicy.defaults` | 1h to 2160h, ECDSA 256 to 384 | What an issuer's entry does not override. P-384 is the chart's key, P-256 is what the leaf roles still accept. |
| `approverPolicy.namespacedIssuers.enabled`, `.name` | `false`, `namespaced-issuers` | ONE allow-all policy for every namespaced `Issuer`. Refused while a `kind: Issuer` sits in `pki.issuers`. |
| `approverPolicy.requesters` | cert-manager's ServiceAccount | Who is bound `use`: subjects of the `ClusterRoleBinding`. |
| `approverPolicy.roleName` | `<release>-approver-use` | Name of the `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding`. |
| `approverPolicy.annotations` | `{}` | On every object of the layer. |
| `admissionPolicy.enabled` | `false` | Render the [admission policy](trust/workload-identity.md#the-admission-policy) for namespaces at mTLS level `enforced`: a `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` and binding (Kubernetes 1.30+). At least one of the three rules must be on. |
| `admissionPolicy.name` | `<release>-mtls-enforced` | Name of both objects. |
| `admissionPolicy.labels`, `.annotations` | `{}` | On both objects (annotations merge over `commonAnnotations`). |
| `admissionPolicy.namespaceLabel.key`, `.value` | `mtls-level`, `enforced` | Only a namespace carrying this label is touched. |
| `admissionPolicy.validationActions` | `[Deny]` | Any of `Deny`, `Warn`, `Audit`. `[Warn, Audit]` is the dry run: warnings and audit annotations, nothing refused. |
| `admissionPolicy.failurePolicy` | `Fail` | `Fail` or `Ignore`; `Fail` refuses what the policy cannot evaluate. |
| `admissionPolicy.workloads` | `true` | Also check the pod template of Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, ReplicaSets, Jobs and CronJobs, so a bad workload is refused at apply time. Pods are always checked. |
| `admissionPolicy.exemptAnnotation` | `mtls-exempt` | An annotation with a non-empty value (the reason) on a Pod, a workload's pod template or a Service exempts that object. |
| `admissionPolicy.csi.enabled`, `.driver` | `true`, `spiffe.csi.cert-manager.io` | Rule: every container mounts a volume of this CSI driver. |
| `admissionPolicy.csi.ignoreContainers` | `[]` | Container names the rule skips, e.g. an injected sidecar. |
| `admissionPolicy.serviceAccount.enabled` | `true` | Rule: no `default` or unset ServiceAccount. |
| `admissionPolicy.services.enabled` | `true` | Rule: every Service port is TLS. |
| `admissionPolicy.services.tlsAppProtocols` | `[https, tls, grpcs, kubernetes.io/wss]` | A port is TLS when its `appProtocol`, lower-cased, is listed. No `appProtocol` is plaintext. |
| `admissionPolicy.services.allow` | `[]` | Service names, or `name/portName`, that may stay plaintext. |
| `admissionPolicy.services.gatewayFrontedAnnotation` | `gateway-fronted` | A Service annotated with this key set to `"true"` is exempt from the port rule. |
| `alerts.enabled` | `false` | Render the [issuance alerts](trust/issuance.md#alerts): the rules for a Certificate not Ready, a denied request, csi-driver-spiffe and approver-policy unavailable, a Certificate ending or not renewed, a CA ending, cert-manager's metrics gone. |
| `alerts.format` | `vmrule` | `vmrule` (VMRule), `prometheusrule` (PrometheusRule) or `configmap` (the plain rules file under `issuance-alerts.rules.yaml`). |
| `alerts.name`, `.namespace` | `<release>-issuance-alerts`, the release namespace | The object's name and namespace. |
| `alerts.labels`, `.annotations` | `{}` | On the object (`ruleSelector` labels; annotations merge over `commonAnnotations`). |
| `alerts.ruleLabels` | `{}` | Added to every rule, for routing; a rule's own `labels` merge over them. |
| `alerts.groupName`, `.interval` | `openbao-issuance`, empty | The rule group's name and evaluation interval. |
| `alerts.selector.namespaceRegex`, `.nameRegex` | empty (every Certificate) | Regexes over the `namespace` and `name` labels of cert-manager's metrics, for the certificate rules. |
| `alerts.workloadNamespace` | `pki.certManager.namespace` | Where csi-driver-spiffe and approver-policy run, for the workload rules. |
| `alerts.rules.<rule>.enabled`, `.for`, `.severity`, `.labels`, `.annotations` | per rule | `certificateNotReady` (30m, warning), `certificateRequestDenied` (off, 5m, critical), `csiDriverSpiffeUnavailable` (10m, critical), `approverPolicyUnavailable` (follows `approverPolicy.enabled`, 10m, critical), `certificateExpiringSoon` (15m, warning), `certificateRenewalOverdue` (15m, warning), `caExpiring` (off, 1h, critical), `metricsAbsent` (15m, warning). |
| `alerts.rules.certificateExpiringSoon.thresholdSeconds` | `604800` | Seven days. |
| `alerts.rules.certificateRenewalOverdue.graceSeconds` | `7200` | Two hours past the renewal time. |
| `alerts.rules.caExpiring.metric`, `.matchers`, `.thresholdSeconds` | `x509_cert_not_after`, empty, `2592000` | The exported not-after timestamp of the CAs, the label matchers selecting them, thirty days. |
| `alerts.rules.certificateRequestDenied.metric`, `.typeLabel` | `kube_customresource_certificaterequest_condition`, `type` | The kube-state-metrics custom resource state metric for CertificateRequest conditions. |
| `alerts.rules.csiDriverSpiffeUnavailable.daemonSetRegex`, `.deploymentRegex` | `cert-manager-csi-driver-spiffe`, `...-approver` | The driver DaemonSet and its approver Deployment. `approverPolicyUnavailable.deploymentRegex` is `cert-manager-approver-policy`. |
| `certificateDefaults.duration`, `.renewBefore` | `720h`, `240h` | Renewal at a third of the lifetime: two chances before anything expires. |
| `certificateDefaults.privateKey` | ECDSA 384, rotation Always | Must match what the role signs; a P-384 leaf role also accepts 256. |
| `certificates[].name` | *required* | |
| `certificates[].namespace` | `pki.certManager.namespace` | |
| `certificates[].commonName`, `.dnsNames` | one required | `dnsNames` defaults to `[commonName]`. |
| `certificates[].secretName` | `<name>-tls` | |
| `certificates[].issuerRef` | the first of `pki.issuers` | |
| `certificates[].uris`, `.usages` | none | |
| `certificates[].duration`, `.renewBefore`, `.privateKey` | `certificateDefaults` | |
| `certificates[].annotations`, `.labels` | `{}` | |

Two entries that would render the same object — two stores, a store and a
writer or an AWS store, two anchors, two issuers, two certificates or their Secrets — fail
the render instead of overwriting each other.

## Hierarchy file

What `openbaoctl pki` reads ([ceremony.md](ceremony.md#the-hierarchy-file)).
Strict: an unknown key is an error. Paths are relative to the file.

| Key | Type | Required | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| `serialNamespace` | string | no, `private-pki` | prefix of every deterministic serial's label (`<ns>-root-serial-v1`, `<ns>-intermediate-serial-v1`, `<ns>-emergency-server-serial-v1`); never change it for an existing root |
| `root.generationId` | string | yes | the generation; part of the root's serial and of every artifact |
| `root.subject.commonName`, `.organization` | string | CN yes | the root's subject; an empty organization is left out |
| `root.notBefore` | RFC 3339 | yes | start of validity; fixed, so the template is reproducible |
| `root.lifetime` | Go duration | yes | e.g. `175200h` |
| `root.maxPathLen` | int ≥ 0 | yes | CA layers below the root; 0 is "leaves only", never unbounded |
| `root.permittedDnsDomains` | list | no | a critical name constraint on the root; omit for none |
| `root.artifact` | path | yes | where the root artifact is written, and `<artifact>.attempt` beside it |
| `intermediates[].trustDomain` | string | yes | the intermediate's name (no spaces or slashes), unique; part of its serial |
| `intermediates[].subject` | as above | CN yes | must equal the CSR's subject exactly |
| `intermediates[].lifetime` | Go duration | yes | from the root's `notBefore`; must end inside the root |
| `intermediates[].permittedDnsDomains` | list | no | a critical constraint that also excludes every IP; each name must sit inside the root's constraint, if any |
| `intermediates[].permittedUriDomains` | list | no | a critical constraint (independent of `permittedDnsDomains`; either makes the extension critical) that also excludes every IP -- a workload-identity domain intermediate's SPIFFE trust domain(s), ADR 0002 |
| `intermediates[].artifact` | path | yes | the intermediate artifact, and its `.attempt` |
| `emergencyServer.dnsName` | DNS name | for `sign-emergency-server` | the one name a break-glass leaf serves; no wildcard |
| `emergencyServer.lifetime` | Go duration | no, `168h` | at most `720h` |

## openbaoctl

Every signing command asks the KMS key for at most one signature. The
region is read from the key ARN; `--aws-profile` (default: the SDK's
chain) is the identity to start from and `--role-arn` the ceremony role
assumed on top of it.

| Command | Flags | Signs |
|---|---|---|
| `pki create-root` | `--hierarchy`, `--key-arn` (required), `--import-certificate`, `--aws-profile`, `--role-arn` | once, unless the artifact exists or a certificate is imported |
| `pki sign-intermediate` | `--hierarchy`, `--trust-domain`, `--csr` (required); exactly one of `--print-template` or `--confirm-template <sha256>`; `--key-arn` (default: the root artifact's), `--aws-profile`, `--role-arn` | only with `--confirm-template`, once, unless the artifact exists |
| `pki verify-intermediate` | `--hierarchy`, `--trust-domain` (required), `--chain-out` (must not exist; default prints the chain) | never; needs no credential |
| `pki sign-emergency-server` | `--hierarchy`, `--csr` (required); exactly one of `--print-template` or `--confirm-template`; `--not-before` (required to sign: the value `--print-template` printed), `--out` (default `openbao-emergency.crt`, must not exist), `--key-arn`, `--aws-profile`, `--role-arn` | only with `--confirm-template`, once per run; nothing is committed |

Each `pki` command reads its PKI from exactly one of `--hierarchy <file>`
(above) or `--contract <file>`, a `pkg/pki` contract ([pki.md](pki.md));
they are mutually exclusive. The contract flags:

| Flag | Applies to | What |
|---|---|---|
| `--contract` | all four `pki` commands | the private-PKI contract file, in place of `--hierarchy` |
| `--generation` | all four, with `--contract` | the root generation ID (required with a contract) |
| `--artifacts` | all four, with `--contract` | overrides the contract's own artifact directory |
| `--environment`, `--zone` | `sign-intermediate`, `verify-intermediate`, with `--contract` | sign or verify one environment's own root-signed CA under a workload-identity domain, instead of the domain's shared intermediate; `--zone` is that environment's own value for `{zone}` and is required with `--environment` |
| `--dns-name` | `sign-emergency-server`, with `--contract` | the break-glass name to sign for (required with a contract; a hierarchy file carries it as `emergencyServer.dnsName`) |

## pkg/custody

`custody.Deploy(ctx, custody.Args{...}, opts...)`; `opts` are appended to
every resource and provider ([custody.md](custody.md)).

| Field | Default | What |
|---|---|---|
| `AccountID` | required | the custody account; also every provider's only allowed account |
| `Partition` | `aws` | the partition every ARN is composed in |
| `Profile` | none | the AWS shared-config profile of every provider |
| `TrustedPrincipalARNPattern` | required | `ArnLike` pattern of the human administrators: assume both roles, administer the keys directly |
| `AdminRoleName`, `CeremonyRoleName` | required, distinct | the two roles |
| `PermissionsBoundaryPolicyName` | none | a customer-managed policy in the account, attached to both roles as their boundary |
| `Generations[]` | at least one | `ID`, `Region` (primary), `ReplicaRegion` (must differ when set; empty creates the primary alone, no replica); oldest first, additive |
| `Notify` | none | e-mail addresses subscribed to every generation's Sign alarm, in both regions |
| `AliasPrefix` | `alias/private-pki/root/` | alias `<prefix><ID>`, the same in both regions |
| `SignAlertPrefix` | `private-pki-root-sign-` | topic, rule and alarm `<prefix><ID>` |
| `DescriptionPrefix` | `Private PKI root` | key description `<prefix> <ID> (multi-region primary)` / `(DR replica)` |
| `RolesProviderName` | `private-pki-root-primary` | the roles' provider, `provider/aws/<name>`, in the first generation's primary region |
| `DeletionWindowDays` | `30` | 7–30 |
| `Tags` | none | `func(TagScope) map[string]string`, called for `roles`, each generation's `key` and each generation's `sign-alert` |
| `BreakGlassPrincipalARNPattern` | none | `ArnLike` pattern of the custody account's break-glass role; adds `DenyDestructiveExceptBreakGlass` (`BreakGlassOnlyActions()` for everyone else) to every key policy and creates the keys with the lockout safety check bypassed; a role in the account, not the trusted pattern ([custody.md](custody.md#break-glass-only-the-deny-and-the-ceremony-trust)) |
| `CeremonyTrustConditions` | none | `[]TrustCondition{Operator, Key, Values}` added to the ceremony role's trust policy only; each pair once, values non-empty |

`Deploy` returns the roles and, per generation, the alias, the regions,
the key and the replica, for the caller's exports.

## pkg/model

The fields of `model.Desired` and what each engine holds; yaml keys in
brackets. [model.md](model.md) explains the shape,
[`desired-one-env.yaml`](../pkg/model/testdata/desired-one-env.yaml) is
the small case and
[`desired.yaml`](../pkg/model/testdata/desired.yaml) spells every field.
Durations are Go durations (`15m`, `720h`).

| Type | Field | Required | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Desired` | `Bootstrap` (`bootstrap`) | yes | the root door the apply logs in through; validated, never applied |
| | `Root` (`root`) | yes | what the apply owns in root; no name |
| | `Namespaces` (`namespaces`) | no | one per environment, a plain name each |
| | `Identity` (`identity`) | yes | `primaryDoor` (required only when a namespace declares a group), and `metadata` every identity group carries |
| | `CredentialMaxTTL` (`credentialMaxTtl`) | no | the ceiling on every SSH user-certificate role and every PKI credential role; does not reach `SSHHostMount` roles, which are capped at 30 days instead |
| `Namespace` | `Name`, `KV`, `PKI`, `SSH`, `SSHHost`, `Auth`, `Projects`, `Policies`, `Groups` | name outside root | the engines below; `Projects` only on an environment |
| `ProjectNamespace` | `Name`, `KV`, `PKI` | name | one project, `<environment>/<project>`; no `Auth`, `Policies`, `Groups`, `SSH` or `SSHHost` -- the type has no such field |
| `KVMount` | `Path`, `Description`, `Canary` | path | a KV v2 mount; the canary is written as `{"namespace": <name>}` |
| `JWTMount` | `Path`, `Type` (empty or `oidc`), `Description`, `ClientID` (oidc), `DefaultRole`, `DiscoveryURL`, `JWKSURL`, `ValidationPubKeys`, `BoundIssuer`, `SupportedAlgorithms`, `Roles` | path, exactly one of discovery URL, JWKS URL, public keys | one auth mount; the discovery URL is also the bound issuer unless `BoundIssuer` is set (an oidc mount needs the discovery URL); `SupportedAlgorithms` empty resolves to `DefaultSupportedAlgorithms` (`Algorithms()`) |
| `Role` | `Name`, `Type`, `BoundAudiences`, `BoundSubject`, `UserClaim`, `GroupsClaim`, `ClaimMappings`, `AllowedRedirectURIs`, `OIDCScopes` (oidc), `Policies`, `TTL` | name, audience, user claim, TTL, and a subject or a groups claim | `TTL` is also the maximum |
| `Group` | `Name`, `Policies`, `Doors` | all | one identity group per door, aliased there by `Name` |
| `Policy`, `Rule` | `Name`, `Rules`; `Path`, `Capabilities`, `DeniedParameters` | all but `DeniedParameters` | rendered in rule order (`Policy.HCL`); `DeniedParameters` renders `denied_parameters = {"<name>" = []}`, refusing a request that carries that parameter at all |
| `PKIMount` | `Path`, `Description`, `DefaultLeaseTTL`, `MaxLeaseTTL`, `DefaultIssuer`, `Issuers`, `Roles`, `CredentialRoles` | all but description and roles | the default issuer is pinned |
| `PKIIssuer` | `Name`, `CommonName`, `Organization`, `KeyCurve` (`P-256`, `P-384`, `P-521`), `TTL`, `MaxPathLength`, `NameConstraints`, and one of `SelfSigned`, `SignedBy`, `External` | name, common name, curve, signer; TTL unless external | issuer names are unique across the server |
| `IssuerRef` | `Namespace` (empty for root), `Mount`, `Issuer` | mount, issuer | an issuer of an earlier mount |
| `NameConstraints` | `PermittedDNSDomains`, `ExcludedIPRanges`, `PermittedEmailAddresses`, `PermittedURIDomains` | no | an empty list is left out |
| `PKIRole` | `Name`, `Issuer`, `AllowedDomains`, `AllowBareDomains`, `AllowSubdomains`, `AllowWildcards` (`allowWildcardCertificates`), `Server`, `Client`, `KeyCurve`, `TTL`, `MaxTTL`, `RenewBefore` | all but `RenewBefore` | `RenewBefore` is for the consumers, not OpenBAO |
| `CredentialRole` | `Name`, `Issuer`, `SubjectMount`, `CNValidations` (`email`, `hostname`), `Server`, `Client`, `KeyCurve`, `TTL`, `MaxTTL` | all but validations | signs only the caller's own alias name on `SubjectMount` |
| `SSHMount` | `Path`, `Description`, `KeyType`, `Roles` | path, key type, a role | the CA key is generated inside OpenBAO; a user CA, never a host CA's mount |
| `SSHRole` | `Name`, `AllowedUsers`, `DefaultUser`, `KeyTypes`, `KeyIDFormat`, `Extensions`, `ForceCommand`, `TTL`, `MaxTTL` | all but extensions and `ForceCommand` | principals spelled out; never root; `ForceCommand` refuses `permit-pty` or a forwarding extension alongside it, and needs a grant that denies `critical_options` (docs/safety.md) |
| `SSHHostMount` | `Path`, `Description`, `KeyType`, `Roles` | path, key type, a role | the host CA key is generated inside OpenBAO, on a mount of its own -- never the same key as an `SSHMount`'s |
| `SSHHostRole` | `Name`, `AllowedDomains`, `AllowBareDomains`, `AllowSubdomains`, `KeyTypes`, `KeyIDFormat`, `TTL`, `MaxTTL` | all | domains spelled out literally; no wildcard, no template; `MaxTTL` capped at 30 days, always |
| `KVLayout` | rows of `Kind`, `Key`, `Properties`, `Writer` | kind, key, properties | `Validate`, `SecretsFor(kind)`, `SecretForKey(key)`, `Kinds()`; `{name}` placeholders |

The access-roster preset ([integrations/access-roster.md](integrations/access-roster.md#the-preset)):

| Type | Field | Default | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Roster` | `Issuer` | required | discovery URL and bound issuer of both doors |
| | `TTL` | required | a login token's whole life, on both doors |
| | `Audience` | `openbao` | the roster role's bound audience: the issuer's exchange client |
| | `GroupsClaim`, `UserClaim` | `groups`, `sub` | the claims both roles map |
| | `ClaimMappings` | none | claim -> alias metadata, on both roles |
| | `Mount`, `Role` | `jwt-roster`, `roster` | the people-and-jobs door and its one role |
| | `Description` | none | the door's description |
| | `UI` | none | adds the web UI's door |
| `RosterUI` | `RedirectURIs` | required | the UI's callback, `UICallback(address, mount)` |
| | `Mount`, `ClientID` | `oidc`, `openbao-ui` | the UI's door and the issuer client it signs in as |
| | `Scopes` | `profile`, `email` | the OIDC scopes asked for |
| | `Description` | none | the door's description |

Methods: `Door()`, `UIDoor()`, `Doors()`, `DoorPaths()`, `Identity(metadata)`
(the roster door primary), `Grant(group, rules...)` and
`JobGrant(group, rules...)` (a policy named after the group, admitted
through every door or the roster door alone), `Bootstrap(operators)` (the
operators' door in root, for `Desired.Bootstrap`), `RootUI(operators)`
(the UI's door into root). `OperatorPolicy(name)` is every capability on
`*`. The names are constants: `RosterMount`, `RosterRole`,
`RosterAudience`, `RosterGroupsClaim`, `RosterUserClaim`, `RosterUIMount`,
`RosterUIClient`.

Helpers: `ServiceAccountSubject(namespace, serviceAccount)`,
`Identity.GroupName(group, door)`, `Identity.GroupMetadata(door)`,
`DurationSeconds(duration)`, `Desired.Applied()` (root, then the
namespaces), `Namespace.Label()` (`root` for root), `ProjectPath(project,
mount, subpath)` (`<project>/<mount>/<subpath>`, a policy rule reaching
into a project -- `Namespace.Validate` refuses one naming a project or a
mount the environment does not declare, and, in an environment with any
project, any rule whose first path segment carries a glob `*` or `+`
rather than one literal name).

## pkg/apply

`apply.Deploy(ctx, &desired, apply.Options{...})` validates, runs
`BeforeApply` (apply only), logs in, and registers every namespace the
model owns on `ctx` ([model.md](model.md#applying-it)).

| Option | Default | What |
|---|---|---|
| `Address` | required | `https://` URL clients reach; the provider's address and the base of every PKI mount's issuer, CRL and OCSP URLs (`<Address>/v1/<ns>/<mount>/...`) |
| `Login.Mount`, `Login.Role` | required | the auth mount and role in root the provider logs in with |
| `Login.Token` | required | returns the JWT; called once, after `BeforeApply`, and marked secret |
| `Login.CACertFile` | none | the PEM file the server's certificate is verified against |
| `ProviderName` | `openbao` | the provider's logical name |
| `BeforeApply` | none | runs on an apply, never on a preview; an error stops the apply |
| `OIDCClientSecrets` | none | client secret by client id; required for every oidc mount's client |
| `SignedChain` | none | returns an external issuer's PEM chain, the issuer's certificate first; required when the model has one. Verify it before returning it |
| `Rename` | none | maps a derived logical name to the name a running state holds; the adoption hook |
| `ResourceOptions` | none | appended to every resource and the provider (a parent, for instance) |

`Deploy` returns `Result`: `Provider`, `Namespaces`, `Certificates`
(self-signed issuers' certificates by issuer name), `CertificateRequests`
(external issuers' requests by issuer name), `SSHCAPublicKeys` (a user
CA's public key by `MountRef{Namespace, Path}`) and `SSHHostCAPublicKeys`
(the same, for a host CA -- never the same key as the user CA at the same
`MountRef.Path`, for rendering an `@cert-authority` line).
`apply.NewProvider(ctx, name, address, login)` creates the same provider
for another program that writes into OpenBAO as the same operator.

`apply.SnapshotJob` is the pre-apply snapshot; pass its `Run` as
`BeforeApply`.

| Field | Default | What |
|---|---|---|
| `Kubectl` | required | runs kubectl (`apply.KubectlWith(kubeconfig)`) |
| `Namespace`, `CronJob` | required | the snapshot CronJob (`openbao-ops` renders one); the Job is `<CronJob>-pre-apply-<UTC timestamp>` |
| `SkipEnv` | none | an environment variable that, set to a reason, applies without a snapshot |
| `Wait`, `Poll` | `16m`, `5s` | how long to wait for the Job, and how often to look |
| `Logger`, `Now` | `slog.Default()`, `time.Now` | |

## pkg/serverpreset

The server-side HCL and values fragment (docs/server.md): what a plugin
catalog, an awskms seal, the listener, and Raft need on the upstream
`openbao/openbao-helm` chart's server. [`examples/server`](../examples/server)
is a complete, neutral example; [`values.yaml`](../examples/server/values.yaml)
beside it is its golden.

| Type | Field | Required | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Config` | `Arch` | yes | the ONE resolved architecture (see `ResolveArch`) every plugin's checksum is read for |
| | `PluginDirectory` | no | default `/openbao/plugins` (`DefaultPluginDirectory`) |
| | `DownloadBehavior` | no | `"fail"` or `"continue"`; default `"continue"` (`DefaultDownloadBehavior`) — refused otherwise, where the server itself silently ignores anything but those two |
| | `Plugins` | no | the declarative catalog; empty renders no `plugin_*` settings at all |
| | `Seal` | no | zero value renders no seal stanza |
| | `ServerVersion` | no | `"2.7.0"`. Only a guard: from 2.7 a `Seal` with no `Plugin` is refused (the seal is not built in), below 2.6 a `Seal.Plugin` is refused; empty renders as before |
| | `Listener`, `Raft` | no | the `listener "tcp"` and `storage "raft"` stanzas |
| | `UI`, `DisableStandbyReads`, `ServiceRegistration`, `AuditDevice` | no | the top-level settings docs/server.md's reference HCL sets |
| `Plugin` | `Kind`, `Name`, `Image`, `Version`, `BinaryName` | yes | the four `plugin "<Kind>" "<Name>" {}` fields; every value must be one HCL-safe token (no quotes, no line breaks) |
| | `SHA256ByArch` | yes | one checksum per architecture the image is published for — never a bare string |
| | `EgressHosts` | no | every host the OCI pull needs (the registry AND its blob host, when they differ) |
| | `RequiresSTS` | no | true for a plugin that verifies a caller against AWS STS itself |
| `Seal` | `Type` | no | `"awskms"` only; any other type is refused |
| | `Region`, `KMSKeyID` | with `Type` | the `seal "awskms"` block's own fields |
| | `Endpoint` | no | the seal's `endpoint` (a VPC endpoint); `EgressDomains` names its host instead of the public KMS host |
| | `Plugin` | 2.7 | non-nil runs the seal as an external KMS plugin ([server.md](server.md#the-seal-as-a-plugin-openbao-27)): adds the `plugin "kms"` block, `plugin_directory`, and (default delivery) the init container and image volume; nil renders the built-in seal, byte for byte as before |
| `SealPlugin` | `Version` | yes | the plugin's release (`v0.1.0`): the `version` line and the tail of the on-disk name `kms-<seal>-<version>` |
| | `Delivery` | no | `init-copy` (default: an init container copies the binary from a digest-pinned image) or `preinstalled` (HCL only; the binary is already in the plugin directory) |
| | `Image`, `Digest` | `init-copy` | the plugin image's repository (no tag, no digest: an adopter's mirror goes here) and its manifest-list digest `sha256:<64 hex>` |
| | `CopyImage` | `init-copy` | the init container's image; needs `sh`, `cp`, `chmod`, `mv` (the server's own image) |
| | `BinaryName`, `SourceVolume`, `PullPolicy` | no | the binary's name at the image root (`openbao-plugin-kms-aws`), the image volume's name (`seal-plugin-src`), its pull policy (`IfNotPresent`) |
| `Listener` | `Address`, `ClusterAddress`, `TLSCertFile`, `TLSKeyFile` | with a listener | the `listener "tcp"` block |
| `Raft` | `Path`, `Peers` | with Raft | one `retry_join` per `RaftPeer` (`LeaderAPIAddr`, `LeaderCACertFile`, `LeaderTLSServername`) |

Methods: `Plugin.Command()` (`<Kind>-<Name>-<Version>`, the on-disk name
the declarative download links — NOT `BinaryName`); `Plugin.Validate()`;
`Config.Validate()` (which also refuses a seal plugin that cannot be satisfied at startup: no digest, a tag instead of a digest, no copy image, a relative plugin directory, a `kms` entry in `Plugins`); `Config.SealPluginCommand()`, `Config.SealPluginSourceVolume()` and `Config.SealPluginInitContainer(pluginVolume)` (the two halves of the delivery, as plain maps); `Config.PluginHCL()`, `Config.SealHCL()`,
`Config.ListenerHCL()`, `Config.RaftHCL()` (each stanza alone) and
`Config.HCL()` (the whole configuration, in docs/server.md's reference
order); `Config.PluginVolume(name)` / `Config.PluginVolumeMount(name)`
(the plugin directory's emptyDir, as plain maps); `Config.Values(volumeName)`
(the upstream chart's `server.ha.raft.config` plus, when `Plugins` or
`Seal.Plugin` is set, `server.volumes`/`server.volumeMounts`, and with the
default seal plugin delivery the image volume and `server.extraInitContainers`);
`Config.ServerValues(ServerValuesOptions)` (the complete valuesObject of the upstream chart's server: `Values` plus the wiring the HCL assumes, namely the serving Secret and the in-pod CLI, the metrics port, the `ui` Service, `podManagementPolicy: Parallel`, the container security context and the optional signalling sidecar; the image, resources, placement and storage are options; `Config.AuditDescription` is the optional `description` of the audit device); `Config.EgressDomains()` (sorted, deduplicated: every plugin's
`EgressHosts`, AWS STS for any `RequiresSTS` plugin, and the seal's KMS
host); `Config.RetrySidecarContainer(RetrySidecarOptions)` (below);
`ResolveArch(archs)` (the general form of the mixed-architecture refusal:
narrow a node selection to one architecture before pinning a checksum, or
get back why it cannot be narrowed).

`RetrySidecarOptions`: `Image`, `VolumeName` required; `APIPort` (8200),
`HealthTimeoutSeconds` (300), `Attempts` (20), `IntervalSeconds` (30),
`PluginDirectory` (Config's) all default. `RetrySidecarContainer` refuses
when `Plugins` is empty — a server with nothing declarative to download
has nothing for a retry sidecar to retry. It requires
`shareProcessNamespace: true` on the pod, the same setting `tlsReload`
(charts/openbao-ops) already needs for the same reason (it signals `bao
server` across containers); a pod running both sets it once and lists
both under `server.extraContainers`.
