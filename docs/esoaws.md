# External Secrets reading Parameter Store across accounts

`pkg/esoaws` and the `awsStores` of `charts/openbao-consumers` let the
External Secrets Operator (ESO) on a cluster read AWS Systems Manager
Parameter Store parameters that live in another AWS account. The mechanism
is general: it does not know what writes the parameters or why. Every
particular (accounts, regions, clusters, issuers, role names, parameter
names) is an input.

## One identity mode per cluster

A cluster proves who it is in exactly one of two modes. Both the library
(`IdentityMode`) and the chart (`aws.identity`) require you to name the
mode, and neither has a default.

| | `PodIdentity` | `WebIdentity` |
|---|---|---|
| For | EKS | any cluster whose ServiceAccount issuer AWS can reach (self-hosted, and EKS too) |
| What holds AWS credentials | the ESO controller, through EKS Pod Identity | nothing on the cluster, as far as this library is concerned (see below) |
| Cluster side in AWS | `NewClusterIdentity`: a role and a Pod Identity association | nothing |
| Parameters' side | one reader role per grant, trusting the cluster's role | an IAM OIDC provider for the cluster's issuer, and one reader role per grant trusting one ServiceAccount's tokens |
| A store | names its reader `role`, no auth | names its own ServiceAccount (`auth.jwt.serviceAccountRef`), no `role` |
| Admission policy | required, on by default | not needed, off by default |

**The modes are mutually exclusive.** A cluster with an ambient controller
identity next to per-store identities has the weakness of the first and the
cost of the second. Any store that names no auth, by mistake or by intent,
reads as the controller, and that reopens what the admission policy exists
to close. So `NewClusterIdentity` refuses a `WebIdentity` cluster. A
`Cluster` with no mode, or with the other mode's settings, is refused. A
grant that does not fit its cluster's mode is refused. The chart refuses a
store that does not fit `aws.identity`, with a fixture for each mix.

## The chains

### PodIdentity

```
cluster account                               parameters' account
──────────────────────────────────            ─────────────────────────────────
ESO controller pod
  │ EKS Pod Identity
  ▼
cluster identity role          sts:AssumeRole
  (esoaws.NewClusterIdentity)  ─────────────►  reader role, one per grant
  may assume only SourceRoles  the only cross-   (esoaws.NewReaders)
                               account hop       trusts only the cluster identity
                                                   │ ssm:GetParameter*, kms:Decrypt
                                                   ▼ (same account)
                                                 the granted parameters
```

1. The ESO controller's ServiceAccount (`external-secrets/external-secrets`
   by default) is bound by an EKS Pod Identity association to the
   **cluster identity** role. Its trust admits the Pod Identity service for
   that one cluster (account and cluster ARN) and that one namespace and
   ServiceAccount.
2. For each store, ESO assumes the store's `role`, the **reader role** of
   one grant, with the controller's own credentials. This is the only
   cross-account call. Both sides must agree: the cluster identity may
   assume only the exact role ARNs in its `SourceRoles`, and a reader role
   trusts only that cluster's role.
3. ESO then calls SSM as the reader role, inside the parameters' account.

EKS Pod Identity can also chain to a target role by itself (an
association's target role). But an association has one target, and ESO
needs one role per store, so the cluster identity stays in its own account.

### WebIdentity

```
cluster                                       parameters' account
──────────────────────────────────            ─────────────────────────────────
ServiceAccount of one store      sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
  (external-secrets/<grant SA>)  ────────────────────────────►  reader role, one per grant
  token minted by ESO,           verified by the IAM OIDC        trusts sub = that ServiceAccount,
  signed by the cluster's        provider for the cluster's      aud = the cluster's audience
  ServiceAccount issuer          issuer (NewReaders)               │ ssm:GetParameter*, kms:Decrypt
                                                                   ▼ (same account)
                                                                 the granted parameters
```

1. Each store names its own ServiceAccount in the ESO namespace. ESO reads
   the role from the ServiceAccount's `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn`
   annotation. It requests a token for that ServiceAccount, with the
   audience from `eks.amazonaws.com/audience` (default `sts.amazonaws.com`),
   and calls `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`. The chart renders the
   ServiceAccount with both annotations, and it mounts no token; nothing
   runs as it.
2. STS verifies the token with the IAM OIDC provider registered for the
   cluster's issuer in the parameters' account. `NewReaders` creates the
   provider, or takes an existing one by ARN. The reader role trusts that
   provider only for `<issuer>:sub = system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<name>`
   and `<issuer>:aud = <audience>`.
3. ESO calls SSM as the reader role, inside the parameters' account.

The store carries no `role` of its own: ESO would assume it on top of the
web identity, and the reader role does not trust itself.

"Nothing on the cluster holds AWS credentials" is true only of what this
library creates. It stays true only if nothing outside it grants the ESO
controller's ServiceAccount AWS rights: no Pod Identity association or IRSA
annotation of its own, and no node role reachable from its pods that may
assume a reader role. If something does, the cluster is in effect in both
modes, and the admission policy is needed again.

The issuer must be reachable from AWS. The cluster's API server signs
ServiceAccount tokens with an `iss` of its `--service-account-issuer`, and
STS fetches that URL's `/.well-known/openid-configuration` and the keys it
points to. On a self-hosted cluster that usually means publishing the
discovery document and the JWKS on a public HTTPS host, such as a static
bucket, and setting the API server's issuer to that URL. `IssuerURL` must
match the tokens' `iss` exactly, with no trailing slash and the host in
lower case (IAM names the provider and its condition keys by the URL as
written). An EKS cluster's
own issuer works too.

## Encryption: the default key is enough

A SecureString is decrypted by SSM, on behalf of the caller, with the key
it was written with. In both modes the caller is the reader role, which
belongs to the parameters' own account. So the account's default `aws/ssm`
key works: its key policy lets any principal of the account use it through
SSM, and the reader role needs no KMS grant. (`aws/ssm` cannot be shared
with another account. That is why the reader role lives with the
parameters, and the trust is the only cross-account hop.)

Set `Grant.KMSKeyARN` only when the parameters are encrypted with a
customer-managed key. The reader role then gets `kms:Decrypt` on that key,
only through SSM in the source's region (`kms:ViaService`) and only for the
granted parameters (`kms:EncryptionContext:PARAMETER_ARN`). The key's own
policy must also admit the role. The key must be in the source's region,
and it may be in another account if its key policy allows that.

## Least privilege

- **The cluster identity** (PodIdentity mode) may call `sts:AssumeRole` and
  `sts:TagSession` on its exact `SourceRoles` and nothing else. It has no
  SSM or KMS permissions of its own. Patterns are refused: reader role ARNs
  are predictable (`arn:aws:iam::<account>:role/<grant>`), and a pattern
  would trust roles that someone creates later.
- **Session tags.** Every trust and policy here that allows `sts:TagSession`
  admits only EKS Pod Identity's six tag keys (`eks-cluster-arn`,
  `eks-cluster-name`, `kubernetes-namespace`, `kubernetes-service-account`,
  `kubernetes-pod-name`, `kubernetes-pod-uid`), through
  `ForAllValues:StringEquals` on `aws:TagKeys`. A store cannot add its own
  tags to a reader's session, and the chart renders no `sessionTags`.
  WebIdentity trusts allow no `sts:TagSession` at all.
- **A reader role** may call `ssm:GetParameter` and `ssm:GetParameters` on
  its exact parameters and under its prefixes, and `ssm:GetParametersByPath`
  on its prefixes only. It cannot write anything, and it cannot call
  `ssm:DescribeParameters`. As a result, an ExternalSecret's `find` must
  name a `path` inside a prefix grant. A `find` by name or by tag without a
  path lists the whole account, so it is refused.
- **A grant's parameters** are exact names (`/app/config/token`, or `token`
  outside any hierarchy) or prefixes (`/app/config/`, which covers the path
  at any depth). An entry may also be given as a parameter ARN. Every ARN is
  built in, or must be in, the source's own account and region. These are
  refused: wildcards, `/` alone, empty path segments, duplicates, and an
  entry already covered by a prefix in the same grant.
- **Size.** IAM allows an inline policy up to 10,240 characters. A grant or
  a cluster identity whose policy would be larger is refused before anything
  registers. Use a prefix instead of a long list of names.

## Tenancy: one store per (cluster, grant)

Any namespace that can use a store can read everything its grant reads.
So the unit of access is the grant: one reader role per audience, and one
`ClusterSecretStore` per (cluster, grant), limited by `conditions` to the
namespaces of that audience. A condition must select something: a
non-empty list of namespaces, or a `namespaceSelector` with labels or
expressions. An empty selector selects every namespace, so it is refused.
An `awsStores` expression must use the `In` operator with at least one
value: `NotIn`, `Exists` and `DoesNotExist` select namespaces nobody listed.
`awsStores` take no namespace regexes. An OpenBAO store's regexes must be
anchored (`^...$`), with no `|` outside a group (write `^(?:a|b)$`), and
none may match every namespace.

What each mode guarantees beyond that:

- **PodIdentity.** The controller's identity can assume every reader role
  of the cluster, so the guarantee rests on what may use that identity.
  Only the release's stores may: see [the admission policy](#the-admission-policy).
- **WebIdentity.** Each reader role trusts one ServiceAccount in the ESO
  namespace, and nothing on the cluster holds credentials. A namespaced
  `SecretStore` can reference only a ServiceAccount in its own namespace,
  so a tenant who creates one gets a token whose subject no reader role
  trusts. The guarantee holds as long as nobody but administrators may
  create objects, or ServiceAccount tokens, in the ESO namespace. The
  store's reference must name that namespace: without it, a
  `ClusterSecretStore` resolves the ServiceAccount in each ExternalSecret's
  own namespace. The chart's schema requires the namespace.

## The admission policy

In PodIdentity mode, ESO uses the controller's credentials for any AWS
object that names no auth of its own: a namespaced `SecretStore`, an
`ECRAuthorizationToken` or `STSSessionToken` generator, or a
`ClusterSecretStore`. An empty `auth: {}` counts as no auth. Anyone who may
create a `SecretStore` could set `role` to a reader's ARN and read that
grant from their own namespace. Two controls close that:

1. `aws.admissionPolicy`, a ValidatingAdmissionPolicy that the chart turns
   on by default in `podIdentity` mode (Kubernetes 1.30+). It refuses:
   - an AWS `SecretStore`, an `ECRAuthorizationToken` or `STSSessionToken`,
     or a `ClusterGenerator` wrapping either, without `secretRef` or `jwt`
     auth;
   - an AWS `ClusterSecretStore` that is not one of this release's
     `awsStores`;
   - one of the release's own stores that differs from what the release
     renders. In `podIdentity` mode it must assume exactly the rendered
     `role`, with no `auth`, `additionalRoles`, `sessionTags`,
     `transitiveTagKeys` or `externalID`. In `webIdentity` mode it must read
     as exactly the rendered ServiceAccount, with no `role`, keys or extra
     audiences. A GitOps apply leaves fields it does not declare in place,
     so a store edited or created outside the release would otherwise keep
     them.

   A store with its own keys or its own ServiceAccount is admitted, because
   it reads as itself. An update is judged even while its object waits on a
   finalizer to be deleted, since ESO still reads it. Only a finalizer's
   removal that leaves the spec as it was is let through. One release should
   render a cluster's `awsStores`, since the policy admits only its own. In
   `podIdentity` mode, turning the policy off, dropping `Deny` (the
   `[Warn, Audit]` dry run) or setting `failurePolicy: Ignore` fails the
   render unless `acknowledgeTenantsCanBorrowControllerIdentity: true` says
   so. `just admission-conformance` proves all of it on a real API server,
   against ESO's CRDs.
   The policy judges writes only. An object that already existed when the
   policy was first installed stays as it is until its next update. After
   the first install, list every AWS `SecretStore` and generator that names
   no auth of its own (it needs `jq`). Each line it prints is one to fix or
   delete:

   ```sh
   kubectl get secretstores,ecrauthorizationtokens,stssessiontokens,clustergenerators -A -o json | jq -r '.items[] | (if .kind == "SecretStore" then .spec.provider.aws elif .kind == "ClusterGenerator" then (.spec.generator.ecrAuthorizationTokenSpec // .spec.generator.stsSessionTokenSpec) else .spec end) as $a | select($a != null and $a.auth.secretRef == null and $a.auth.jwt == null) | "\(.kind) \(.metadata.namespace // "-")/\(.metadata.name)"'
   ```

2. In the upstream ESO chart, `rbac.aggregateToEdit: false` and
   `rbac.aggregateToAdmin: false`. Those settings add create on
   `secretstores`, `externalsecrets` and the generators to every
   namespace's `edit` and `admin` roles. Tenants still need to create
   `ExternalSecret`s, so grant that alone, with your own role.

### Upgrades: the policy goes first

The policy holds what each of the release's stores may say. So when a
release changes a store's role or ServiceAccount, or adds a store, the
policy that is still live knows only the old shape and refuses the new
store. The chart cannot order objects within one apply, and the API server
picks up a changed policy asynchronously, usually within a second or two.
What keeps an upgrade moving:

- The policy and its binding carry `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "-1"` by
  default, so Argo CD applies them before the stores (wave 0 unless you set
  one). The policy's own `annotations` override it. If your stores carry an
  earlier wave, for example through `commonAnnotations`, keep the policy's
  wave below theirs.
- Within the pickup delay, a store can still be refused once. Give the
  Argo CD application a sync retry (`syncPolicy.retry`, a few attempts with
  backoff), and the next attempt is admitted.
- `helm upgrade --atomic` rolls the whole release back on that first
  refusal. Either apply in two steps (render and apply the policy alone with
  `--show-only templates/aws-admission.yaml`, then upgrade), or upgrade
  without `--atomic` and run it again if it is refused.

`just admission-conformance` proves the sequence: under the old policy the
changed and the added store are refused, and once the new policy is applied
and picked up they are admitted, and the old role is refused.

In WebIdentity mode neither control is needed for these stores. A store with
no auth has no credentials to borrow: the node's role, if the controller can
reach it, is not a principal any reader role trusts. The policy can still be
turned on (`aws.admissionPolicy.enabled: true`) as a second line.
[safety.md](safety.md#an-aws-identity-any-namespace-can-borrow) has the
same in the list of refusals.

## Writer stores: the narrow exception

Everything above is read-only: a reader role cannot write, and the admission
policy refuses any AWS `ClusterSecretStore` the release does not render. A few
flows need the other direction: a `PushSecret` that copies a Kubernetes Secret
(a certificate cert-manager renews, say) into Parameter Store for a consumer
that has no cluster. `awsWriters` and `esoaws.NewWriters` are that exception,
and they are built to stay one:

- **PodIdentity only.** A writer store assumes a writer role with the
  controller's own credentials, so it needs the admission policy to hold it.
- **One role per prefix.** `WriteGrant.Prefix` is one parameter path
  (`/app/client/`: starts and ends with `/`, never `/`, no wildcard). The
  role may `ssm:GetParameter`, `PutParameter`, `AddTagsToResource` and
  `ListTagsForResource` on that path (`parameter/app/client/*`) and nothing
  else: no delete, no other path, no `DescribeParameters`. `GetParameter`
  and `ListTagsForResource` are what the provider calls before it
  overwrites (it compares the stored value and refuses a parameter it did not
  create); it never deletes unless a `PushSecret` sets `deletionPolicy:
  Delete`, which this role cannot do.
- **A customer-managed key, required.** `WriteGrant.KMSKeyARN`, or `KMSKey`
  when the same program makes the key (an output; the policy waits for it). The writer
  gets `kms:Encrypt`, `Decrypt` and `GenerateDataKey` on it, through SSM
  only and for the prefix's parameters only. Parameters on the account's
  default `aws/ssm` key are readable by every principal that may call SSM,
  which is why a reader of a *secret* written here must be named in the
  key's policy. `WriterKeyPolicyStatement` is the writer's statement for
  that policy, in the shape the account root narrowed by `aws:PrincipalArn`
  takes. `NewSecureStringKey` builds the whole of it: the key (30-day
  deletion window, rotation, protected), its alias, the writer role, and a
  key policy of key administration for the account root (no cryptographic
  action), the writer, the named readers (`KeyReader`: a role ARN pattern and
  the parameters it decrypts, or a ready-made statement from a library that
  owns the reader's half) and a recovery role. `SecureStringKeyPolicy`
  renders the document alone. Writers built apart by one estate are held to
  each other by `CheckWriterClaims` (one role and one prefix per claim, no
  prefix inside another's).
- **The same trust as a reader.** Only the cluster identity role
  (`NewClusterIdentity`; add the writer role to its `SourceRoles`), for
  `sts:AssumeRole` and Pod Identity's tag keys.
- **The chart pins it.** `awsWriters[]` renders a `ClusterSecretStore` with
  `service: ParameterStore`, the writer `role`, and `prefix` (ESO puts
  the provider's `prefix` in front of every `remoteKey`, for reads and pushes
  alike, so a `PushSecret` names `ca`, not `/app/client/ca`). It is usable
  from exactly one namespace, named (no selector, no regex). The writer
  role must not be any `awsStores` role.
- **The admission policy admits exactly that store.** A release store is
  judged against what the release renders: a writer store must carry its
  role, region, prefix and the Parameter Store service, and no `auth`,
  `additionalRoles`, `sessionTags` and so on; a *reader* store must carry no
  `prefix`. Another writer store, a writer store with a wider prefix, or a
  reader store pointed at a writer role is refused. `just
  admission-conformance` proves each.

The consequence to keep in view: the store is as narrow as its namespace and
its role. Anyone who can create a `PushSecret` in the store's namespace can
write the prefix, so choose a namespace only administrators change, and name
the prefix for one purpose.

## Wiring it up

The order matters. IAM resolves a trust policy's principal when the policy
is written, and refuses one that does not exist. Apply in this order:

- PodIdentity: the cluster identity, then the readers, then the stores.
- WebIdentity: the readers (which create the provider first), then the
  stores.

If a cluster identity is deleted and recreated, apply its readers again:
IAM stored the old role's unique id, not its name.

```go
import "github.com/truvity/secrets/pkg/esoaws"

// PodIdentity, in the cluster's account. Nothing like it exists for a
// WebIdentity cluster.
id, err := esoaws.NewClusterIdentity(ctx, esoaws.ClusterIdentityArgs{
    Mode:        esoaws.PodIdentityMode,
    Name:        "a-external-secrets",
    Provider:    clusterAccount,
    ClusterName: pulumi.String("a"),
    ClusterARN:  "arn:aws:eks:eu-example-1:111122223333:cluster/a",
    AccountID:   "111122223333",
    Region:      "eu-example-1",
    SourceRoles: []string{"arn:aws:iam::444455556666:role/a-app-config"},
})

// In the parameters' account: cluster a on Pod Identity, cluster b on web
// identity.
readers, err := esoaws.NewReaders(ctx, esoaws.ReadersArgs{
    Name:      "parameter-readers",
    Provider:  sourceAccount,
    AccountID: "444455556666",
    Region:    "eu-example-1",
    Clusters: []esoaws.Cluster{
        {Name: "a", Mode: esoaws.PodIdentityMode,
            PodIdentity: &esoaws.PodIdentity{RoleARN: "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/a-external-secrets"}},
        {Name: "b", Mode: esoaws.WebIdentityMode,
            WebIdentity: &esoaws.WebIdentity{IssuerURL: "https://oidc.b.example.com"}},
    },
    Grants: []esoaws.Grant{
        {Name: "a-app-config", Cluster: "a", Parameters: []string{"/app/config/", "/shared/endpoint"}},
        {Name: "b-app-config", Cluster: "b", Parameters: []string{"/app/config/"},
            ServiceAccount: &esoaws.ServiceAccount{Name: "eso-b-app-config"}}, // namespace: external-secrets
    },
})
```

The chart values on cluster `a`:

```yaml
aws:
  identity: podIdentity
awsStores:
  - name: a-app-config
    region: eu-example-1
    role: arn:aws:iam::444455556666:role/a-app-config
    conditions:
      - namespaces: [example-app]

and on cluster `b`:

```yaml

```

| Output | Where | What reads it |
|---|---|---|
| `ClusterIdentity.RoleARN` (registered output `roleArn`), `RoleName` (`roleName`) | the cluster's stack (PodIdentity) | the reader side's `PodIdentity.RoleARN` |
| `Readers.RoleARNs[<grant>]` (`roleArns`, by grant name) | the parameters' stack | `SourceRoles` (PodIdentity), and `awsStores[].role` |
| `Readers.OIDCProviderARNs[<cluster>]` (`oidcProviderArns`, by cluster name) | the parameters' stack | nothing on the cluster; it is there to adopt or share the provider |

All the ARNs are predictable (`arn:aws:iam::<account>:role/<name>`,
`arn:aws:iam::<account>:oidc-provider/<issuer without https://>`), so each
side can be written before the other exists.

## Resources

The type and logical name of every resource are part of the package's
contract, as in [awsserver.md](awsserver.md#the-alias-contract). `<N>` is
the `Name` argument, `<G>` a grant's `Name` and `<C>` a cluster's `Name`. A
constructor's options go to its component, and the children inherit them
through the parent.

| Constructor | Kind (Pulumi type) | Logical name | Parent |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NewClusterIdentity` | `truvity:secrets/esoaws:ClusterIdentity` (component) | `<N>` | caller's |
| | `aws:iam/role:Role` | `<N>` | the component |
| | `aws:iam/rolePolicy:RolePolicy` (policy name `assume-parameter-readers`) | `<N>-policy` | the component |
| | `aws:eks/podIdentityAssociation:PodIdentityAssociation` | `<N>-pia` | the component |
| `NewReaders` | `truvity:secrets/esoaws:Readers` (component) | `<N>` | caller's |
| | `aws:iam/openIdConnectProvider:OpenIdConnectProvider` (a WebIdentity cluster with no `ProviderARN`) | `<N>-<C>-oidc` | the component |
| | `aws:iam/role:Role` | `<G>` | the component |
| | `aws:iam/rolePolicy:RolePolicy` (policy name `<G>`) | `<G>-policy` | the component |

The policy documents are also exported as functions
(`ClusterTrustPolicy`, `ClusterPolicy`, `ReaderTrustPolicy`,
`ReaderPolicy`). `pkg/esoaws/testdata` holds them as goldens, with one
reader trust for each mode.

## The chart's name

`awsStores` render in `openbao-consumers` because that chart already holds
the cluster's External Secrets stores and their tenancy rules. These stores
have nothing to do with OpenBAO, so the name no longer describes everything
the chart does. The chart keeps its name for now: a rename changes every
adopter's OCI path and should be a release decision of its own.
